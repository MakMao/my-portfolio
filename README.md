## My Process

It took me quite some time to build this Protein Store. I already built an E-Commerce store before, however, I decided to challenge myself a bit more this time by adding some more in depth features.
I set up my own API with JSON, used firebase for login/sign in functions, stripe for payment options, and many libraries such as yup, axios, formik etc. Everything in this project is built from scratch, which means that this is not a modification from an already existing project.

I do like to mention here that the main focus was on the frontend side of the project, however, as I was building this project it was tempting to include the backend part as well which I eventually did. As for the CSS, I used 'styled components' which I believe is the best approach when building a project with many components. That said, it's harder to write DRY code as applying BEM is very complicated when using styled components. I did spent a significant amount of time on the CSS.
