## My Process

Hello, my name is Max van Beek, and I started my coding journey in 2021. It didn't take me a long time to realise that there is a hidden passion for front-end development in me. That resulted in me working fulltime on achieving my goal: becoming a front-end developer. During the past 12 months, I followed multiple courses and built countless projects. As of now I think I am ready for the next step which is finding a job as Junior ReactJS developer!

In the last 12 months, I have built numerous applications to enhance my development skills. This portfolio contains some of the projects I created that I am excited to share with you.
