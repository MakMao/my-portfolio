## My Process

Hello, my name is Max van Beek, and I started my coding journey in 2021. It didn't take me a long time to realise that there is a hidden passion for front-end development in me. That resulted in me working fulltime on achieving my goal: becoming a front-end developer. During the past 12 months, I followed multiple courses and built countless projects. As of now I think I am ready for the next step which is finding a job as Junior ReactJS developer!

This portolio was built with ReactJS, vanilla CSS and several JavaScript libraries such as formik, yup, axios, react-router-dom and more.
